🌾 Agriculture Data Analysis
🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data such as rainfall, temperature, crop yield, and irrigation trends over different years and regions.
The dataset was sourced from an AWS S3 bucket, processed in Snowflake, and visualized using Power BI to create insightful reports on rainfall patterns, seasonal variations, and crop performance.

🧩 Project Workflow
1. Data Source (AWS S3)

Uploaded the raw agriculture dataset (AGRICULTURE_DATA.csv) into an AWS S3 bucket.

The dataset includes columns like Year, Location, Rainfall, Temperature, Crops, Soil_Type, Irrigation, and more.

2. Data Integration (Snowflake)

Created a new database and table in Snowflake.

Used Snowflake’s external stage to load data directly from the S3 bucket.

3. Data Cleaning & Transformation

📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop to create an interactive dashboard named “Rainfall Analysis”.

Report Highlights:

Average Rainfall,temperature etc  by Year,season,crop type,location  and many more.

Which years/regions received higher rainfall

How seasons affect rainfall and crop growth

Regional crop distribution and weather impact
